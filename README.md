## The plan...
This is a plugin that will
- Allow you to generate a github link for any file you are in to make it easy to share with coworkers
- Allow you to take a github link and automatically switch to the branch, commit, and open the file and any lines referenced in the URL

## Where are we at now?
- Currently functionality exists to generate github links for files inside neovim, this can be done with the command `Gplink`!
