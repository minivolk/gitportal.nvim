# ðŸš§ UNDER CONSTRUCTION ðŸš§
#### This plugin is not complete. You can track my progress here with this [milestone](https://github.com/trevorhauter/gitportal.nvim/milestone/1). 
#### Current expected release date: October 31, 2024.

## ê©œ Use cases
#### You want to quickly share a file with a coworker 
- `gitportal` will generate a shareable permalink - optionally with line ranges - allowing you to easily share this file

#### A coworker shares a file with you 
- `gitportal` will accept shareable permalinks, switch to the proper commit or branch, open the file, and go to or highlight any relevant lines embedded in the url

## ê©œ Where are we at now?
If you would like to test this plugin, here are the features available right now...
- Generate a shareable permalink for any file hosted by GitHub using the command `Gplink`
    - NOTE: GitHub is currently the only supported host, and, line ranges are not currently respected 

## ê©œ Installation
